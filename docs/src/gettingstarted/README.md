# Getting started
This chapter contains the steps to get started with the Go library and the Python wrapper. You will learn how to build the library/wrapper, how to run the test suite and how to debug possible errors.

Note that the Python wrapper is currently the only wrapper. So for now, we only document the Python wrapper in this documentation and in the future document the other wrappers as well.

The documentation on how to use this library in your own code will be given in the next chapter: [API](../api/index.html).
