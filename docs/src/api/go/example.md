# Example with comments
The following is an example [in the repository](https://github.com/eduvpn/eduvpn-common/blob/main/cmd/cli/main.go). It is a command line client with the following flags
```
  -get-custom string
        The url of a custom server to connect to
  -get-institute string
        The url of an institute to connect to
  -get-secure string
        Gets secure internet servers
```
```go
{{#include ../../../../cmd/cli/main.go}}
```

The documentation to then use this API is online at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/eduvpn/eduvpn-common).

[We also provide an example](./example.md).
