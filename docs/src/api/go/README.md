# Go
The API that has no additional wrapper code is the Go API. To begin to use the Go library in a Go client you first need to import it:

```go
import "github.com/eduvpn/eduvpn-common/client"
```

This brings the client library into scope using the client prefix.

The documentation to then use this API and the rest is online at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/eduvpn/eduvpn-common).

[We also provide an example](./example.md).
